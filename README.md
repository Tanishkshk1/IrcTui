## ❖ What is Irconic?

**Irconic** — a name born of irony, of wire, and of the last remnants of conversation in this dying digital age.  
It is a TUI-based IRC client, built not to dazzle, but to endure. Not to perform, but to reflect.  
Written in **Rust**, the language of steel and safety, Irconic is a terminal-bound relic forged in the fire of modern solitude.

This is not an app.  
It is a confession booth.  
A monologue to the void.  
A last attempt at *connection*, in a world obsessed with noise.
